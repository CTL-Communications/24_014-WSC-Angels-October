                          when they experience a stroke, treatment outcomes for
                          women are worse. Age and its attendant comorbidities
                          are also part of the reason why women are
                          under-represented in treatment trials; they are also

                          childbirth. Atrial fibrillation is more likely to
                          cause stroke in women, and women have twice the

                          after their first stroke women are twice as likely to
                          experience a secondary and typically more severe

                          “A woman may ignore a mild stroke and only go to the
                          doctor once she has dropped the kids at school. She
                          will arrive too late for recanalization therapy, which
                          in mild and moderate strokes is practically a
                          cure.”&nbsp;</span

                          reason why hospitals shy away from data collection.
                          “We receive the largest number of stroke patients in

                          two hours a week. Perhaps there are hospitals that
                          cannot spare two hours of a neurologist’s time, but we
                          have someone who does it and enters every single

                          anecdotal for now but there are signs that the message

                          see women who say, ‘I have changed my life, I have
                          changed my priorities. I have realized my health is
                          important, because if I am well, everyone is
