                          Hadzhivalcheva. Elica is the founder of Heart to Heart

                          cardiovascular disease, a cause to which she devoted

                          attack in 2016. Dimitar is a process improvement
                          specialist in the FMCG sphere. Their story began on a
                          Friday evening in August 2017&nbsp;</span

                          interested in meeting someone new, they met again for
                          lunch the very next Tuesday, during which Dimitar
                          learnt that, as well as being a great beauty, Elica
                          had invested her life with meaning by devoting her

                          “We got married to show our devotion to each other.
                          Marriage was a symbol we gave to one

                          to ask myself how I was handling my life and work.
                          Then, suddenly, a great pain from my personal history
                          burst into my life with overwhelming force. Following
                          that, of course, like any other person I also had many
                          unproductive months in which sadness, anger, and
                          despair hindered everything, including my

                          survive is to become more organized, more disciplined,
                          and to rely solely on your own strength to accomplish
                          your daily tasks and life goals. In this sense, my
