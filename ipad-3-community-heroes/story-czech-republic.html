Official sanction from the ministry of health came in October, the same month Angels consultant Robert Havalda was invited to conduct a simulation that was to be a test of teamwork and time. </span></span></span>

When at the start of 2023 the first of them was ready to start treating stroke patients independently, it was Martin who traveled up to Most for a fresh round of simulation training.</span></span></span>

With door-to-needle times of 18 and 13 minutes respectively, and all the key priority actions recommended by Angels implemented as part of the pathway, the exercise boosted the confidence of both the newly qualified Dr Vasyl Uhrynchuk and his team. </span></span></span>
