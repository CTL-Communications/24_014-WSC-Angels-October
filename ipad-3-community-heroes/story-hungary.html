                                                                   width="800" height="450" loading="lazy"></p>

                                    <p>At Péterfy Hospital in downtown Budapest, urgency is a matter of course. As well
                                        as a general hospital it is a trauma centre where the difference between life
                                        and death is often measured in seconds.</p>

                                    <p>An environment geared for speed, it is a felicitous setting for treating stroke
                                        where the cost of a minute wasted is counted in 1,9 million neurons, 14 billion
                                        synapses and 12 kms of myelinated fibres through which human thoughts pass.
                                        Conversely, every minute saved between symptom onset and treatment to restore
                                        the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain can make the difference between a
                                        life-altering catastrophe and a life resumed.</p>

                                    <p>Keenly aware of the difference a minute makes, the stroke team at Péterfy
                                        Hospital thrived in this high-paced environment where every piece of
                                        infrastructure supported their own efforts to eliminate delay, streamline
                                        decision making and ensure not a single patient fell outside the therapeutic
                                        window. A spirit of friendly competition among especially the younger stroke
                                        physicians further cut into door-to-needle times, delivering significant
                                        benefits for their patients.</p>

                                    <p>But in May 2021, as the global healthcare sector was starting to emerge from the
                                        most serious health crisis in a century, the stroke team at Péterfy Hospital
                                        was facing a crisis of its own. Institutional restructuring would relocate the
                                        neurology department to a building a kilometre away, replacing their
                                        built-for-speed infrastructure with a relatively tranquil setting. Their
                                        challenge would be to provide a similar level of care in an environment far less
                                        primed for the prompt action and laser-sharp focus that save lives in an
                                        emergency.</p>

                                    <p>Barely 18 months later, Péterfy Hospital is about to become only the third
                                        hospital in Hungary to earn an ESO Angels Diamond Award, given to hospitals that
                                        meet the most stringent criteria for excellence in stroke care.</p>

                                    <p>Hard work aside, here are five reasons why the stroke team at Péterfy Hospital
                                        didn’t only meet the challenge, but overcame it to qualify for an international
                                        award.</p>

                                    <h3>1 They did it as a team</h3>

                                    <p>Stroke care is teamwork. The stronger a team, the better outcomes they deliver
                                        for their patients. When confronted with a challenge that could potentially
                                        impact all their future patients, the doctors at Péterfy Hospital rallied their
                                        team spirit and by looking for solutions together turned a crisis into a
                                        problem-solving challenge.</p>

                                    <h3>2 Leadership is shared</h3>

                                    <p>Lead by the chief of neurology Dr Pál Salacz who set the tone, everyone in the
                                        team took ownership of the challenge and shared their ideas for mitigating the
                                        impact of the move on patient care. This positive attitude spread to everyone
                                        they asked to help them adapt to the new situation – from their colleagues in
                                        radiology, the laboratory and ICU to their partners in the EMS.</p>

                                    <h3>3 They had good practices already in place</h3>

                                    <p>Before May 2021 prenotification was standard and the call from EMS was received
                                        by the neurologist on duty or the stroke unit. Plus, despite having an emergency
                                        department on the premises, to avoid triage delay and speed up decision making
                                        the neurologist met the patient at the door. There was no reason why they
                                        shouldn’t transfer these practices to their new building where there was the
                                        additional advantage of the patient being brought directly to CT.</p>

                                    <h3>4&nbsp;They brought their sense of urgency with them</h3>

                                    <p>Emergency is not a department but a mindset, and the stroke team at Péterfy
                                        Hospital brought this mindset with them. No longer working in a system that was
                                        geared for speed, they knew that to get the same results they would have to work
                                        even harder. Their approach was to act as if the new building was an emergency
                                        hospital and to bring the urgency and attitudes they had developed in their
                                        previous building across to their new location. That it could take years for an
                                        emergency department to be installed at their new premises now hardly matters,
                                        for where stroke patients admitted to Péterfy Hospital are concerned, there may
                                        as well already be one.</p>

                                    <h3>5 Recognition is a reason to work harder</h3>

                                    <p>Being recognised for their work has brought the stroke team at Péterfy Hospital
                                        even closer together, says the young physician who leads their data collection
                                        effort. “Everybody was happy and excited when we heard of the possibility of
                                        winning the award, and as a result we are working even harder if that’s
                                        possible. At times we feel that our DTN time and recanalisation rate are not
                                        good enough, but this positive feedback clears the doubt and lets us focus on
                                        the work itself so we can improve even further.” Although they don’t need the
                                        spotlight bestowed by an award, they are above all happy that it won’t be one
                                        individual that is recognised but their entire team, for work they can all be
                                        proud of.</p>
