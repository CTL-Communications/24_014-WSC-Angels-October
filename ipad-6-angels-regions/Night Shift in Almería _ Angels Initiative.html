              At the end of Q2 of 2024, Almería in the Spanish province
              Andalusia became one of the first official Angels Regions in

              and EMS performance and public awareness education. In the course

                      <p>
                        <br />“THERE’S a before and after in Almería, a region
                        famous for its exquisite beaches, clear ocean, delicious
                        seafood and outstanding produce, but until recently not
                        for its healthcare. The ‘after’ came in 2022 when the
                        stroke hub in the region, Hospital Universitario
                        Torrecárdenas, was awarded diamond status. This put
                        Almería on the national map.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Almería is not a very big region, but it has many
                        mountains, and remote rural areas that are hard to reach
                        by road and that the tourists don’t see. Its population
                        of around 750,000 fluctuates due to the influx of
                        visitors in summer, but in terms of stroke care they are
                        adequately catered for by one hub and two spoke
                        hospitals. At the start of the 2024 Angels team leader
                        Alicia Arjona and I decided that I would focus on
                        converting Almería into an Angels Region because the
                        motivation was already there.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Implementation of the FAST Heroes campaign was the first
                        box I ticked. A pilot project undertaken some time
                        before had not had much impact but we had a breakthrough
                        when the RES-Q coordinator for the region, Joaquín
                        García, had the brilliant idea of working with the
                        school nurses who are deployed throughout the education
                        system. A meeting with a school nurse coordinator was
                        followed by another where the ministers of education and
                        health were also present. Thanks to their support, more
                        than 50 school nurses attended our FAST Heroes
                        presentation and by July the program had been
                        implemented at 22 schools.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The bright spot in the region was undoubtedly Hospital
                        Universitario Torrecárdenas where Joaquín is the chief
                        of nurses in the stroke unit. Alicia had been working
                        with them since 2019 and they had come a long way,
                        including implementing all the key priority actions to
                        reduce door-to- treatment times. Soon after becoming the
                        first hospital in the region to achieve diamond status,
                        they also became the first hospital in Spain to achieve
                        four consecutive diamond awards.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        About the two smaller hospitals, Hospital Universitario
                        Poniente and Hospital La Inmaculada, I knew very little
                        except that they had both participated in an Angels Day
                        in 2022 and were looking forward to working with us. I
                        followed the same consultancy process at both hospitals,
                        holding multi-disciplinary meetings and enrolling them
                        with RES-Q so they and I could analyze the pathway and
                        evaluate their performance. The simulation training at
                        Hospital Poniente was my first simulation ever, and it
                        went pretty well. Right away, we also agreed plans to
                        implement key priority actions and improve post-acute
                        care at both hospitals.&nbsp;

                      <p>
                        <br />Hospital La Inmaculada is situated in the north,
                        which is the only part of the region not covered by the
                        region’s EMS, the Centro De Emergencias Sanitarias (CES)
                        061 Almería. Primary care physicians attend patients in
                        medicalized vehicles up to an imaginary line called km
                        21, where they are transferred into the care of the CES
                        and transported to the hub. For this reason we are also
                        organizing a training event involving doctors from La
                        Inmaculada, the CES andprimary care. The RACE scale,
                        which is a simple and rapid neurological scale to detect
                        acute stroke patients with a high probability of having
                        a large vessel occlusion, is also being implemented in
                        the north.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Aside from this somewhat unique situation, the CES works
                        really well. Gabriel Navarro Lorenzo is one of the main
                        neurology coordinators. He usually shares this
                        responsibility with his colleague Rocío Escamilla, who
                        has been on maternity leave. Gabriel is really friendly
                        and easy to talk to; he is always willing to share his
                        experience and expertise, as well as learn and
                        collaborate with Angels.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        After getting to know Gabriel I asked him if I could
                        visit the coordination center in Almería. I had
                        previously visited a coordination center in Córdoba with
                        Dr Francisco Aranda. I liked it so much I wanted to get
                        to know others, and as a result of the relationship I
                        was developing with Gabriel this opportunity came up.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        My request elicited some jokes about doing 12-hour
                        shifts like the doctors who work as coordinators do, but
                        I actually thought it was a fantastic idea. Not a
                        12-hour shift, perhaps, but something more than a casual
                        observation. It would be an opportunity to learn more
                        about emergency resources in Almería and at the same
                        time I could improve my relationship with Gabriel.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I wanted to get a clearer idea of how the system worked;
                        how they prioritized the calls, the system they used to
                        filter the calls, the management of the resources they
                        have available, and hopefully see for myself how both
                        the coordination center and the ambulance doctors react
                        in a case of stroke.

                      <p>
                        I don’t think Gabriel believed me at first when I asked
                        if I could come to the coordination center for an
                        observation. He laughed and said, “Are you reaaaally
                        coming?” He may also have been a bit reluctant given how
                        busy and chaotic these shifts can be.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        It turned out that I was going to be in Almería for some
                        other meetings the week Gabriel told me he had a night
                        shift in the coordination center. I thought this would
                        be a perfect opportunity for an observation as they are
                        normally less busy at night. I did not want to disturb
                        the people working there, but I wanted to be able to
                        talk to him and ask him questions, so an evening
                        observation seemed like the best time.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I arrived at the center at 10 pm on Wednesday 16 July.
                        The coordination room is rather a long room with rows of
                        tables where the teleoperators are stationed behind
                        computers. These smaller tables face a bigger table
                        where the doctor (or doctors during daytime) sits in
                        order to facilitate the communication between them.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Among the things that struck me was the way they
                        administered the available resources, the communication
                        with different parts of Andalusia, and the design of the
                        software that helps filter information and categorize
                        situations.
                      </p>

                        <br />Incoming calls are answered by a teleoperator.
                        They have some general questions to ask and, depending
                        on the answers, the software directs them to more
                        specific questions to identify the suspected pathology.
                        The calls are then transferred to the doctor in order to
                        confirm and decide the resource that will be used if
                        necessary. Any doubts or problems that the teleoperators
                        may face during the calls are also referred to the
                        doctor.

                      <p>
                        The thing that surprised me the most was the good
                        communication and good relationship between those in the
                        coordination center and those in the ambulances, which
                        allows for great teamwork. However, there was another
                        thing that surprised me a lot, not in the best way, and
                        that is that people call the emergency services for
                        literally anything, even the most trivial thing you can
                        imagine.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I spoke mostly to Gabriel as I was sitting next to him
                        and the teleoperators were dealing with calls non-stop.
                        I asked a lot of general questions about the software,
                        the communication with the ambulances, the police, and
                        other parts of Andalusia, and the overall administration
                        of the emergency resources. More specifically I asked
                        how the software worked to filter a stroke patient, the
                        general protocol they followed in both the coordination
                        center and the ambulances, how they chose the resource
                        and the hospital, and where there might be areas for
                        improvement.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        To show my appreciation for the warm welcome, I got a
                        pizza for everyone to share for dinner, and left the
                        center around 1.30 am.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        From a consultant’s point of view it was useful to
                        really gain an understanding of how the system works,
                        both inside and outside the coordination center. I also
                        think that Gabriel and I enjoyed sharing the time there.
                        I think I used my time wisely by asking many questions
                        and he explained many things without even being asked.
                        The environment was more relaxed than a normal meeting
                        and I believe that showing an interest in their work and
                        being present improved our relationship in a way a
                        meeting could never have done.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        To consolidate my work in the region, it was important
                        after working with each hospital separately to get them
                        all together in order to create momentum. This
                        opportunity came when the steering committee in the
                        region invited me to help them organize their annual
                        stroke day, which gave me access to all the regional key
                        opinion leaders at the same time, on the same day, in
                        the same room.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I introduced the Angels Region strategy, of course, and
                        I would say there was a contamination of motivation
                        especially when we talked about the Angels Awards. Of
                        course all the hospitals wanted one and we talked about
                        what the next steps could be; what we could do, and how
                        we could help each other.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        When the results were published for quarter two it was
                        confirmed that Hospital Poniente had won a platinum
                        award and La Inmaculata their first gold. Torrecárdenas
                        collected their seventh diamond and CES 061 Almería
                        their third platinum award. With targets already met for
                        hospital coverage and FAST Heroes implementation,
                        Almería became one of the first regions in Europe to be
                        officially recognized as a very proud Angels Region."
